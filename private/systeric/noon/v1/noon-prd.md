# **NoOn Personal CRM \- Product Requirements Document**

## **Executive Summary**

Transform NoOn from a digital business card app into an intelligent Personal CRM that makes relationship maintenance effortless for professionals and entrepreneurs.

---

## **Problem Statement**

### **Current Reality**

**87% of professionals** say relationships are their most valuable career asset, yet **80% fail** to maintain them consistently.

#### **Pain Points**

1. **Contact Decay** \- Information becomes outdated within 6-12 months (job changes, new numbers)  
2. **Relationship Entropy** \- Valuable connections fade from lack of engagement, not lack of caring  
3. **Cognitive Overload** \- Professionals manage 500+ contacts but can only actively maintain \~150  
4. **Lost Opportunities** \- Miss critical moments (job changes, milestones) to reconnect meaningfully  
5. **Action Paralysis** \- Know who to contact but unsure what to say or when

### **Impact of Inaction**

- **Individual:** Career opportunities lost, weakened professional network, relationship guilt  
- **Business:** NoOn remains a commoditized digital business card in a crowded market  
- **Revenue:** One-time hardware sales vs. recurring SaaS with 70% margins

### **Future Vision**

Professionals wake up to 2-3 personalized relationship nudges daily. With one tap, they maintain meaningful connections that drive career growth, business opportunities, and personal fulfillment. Their network becomes an actively managed asset, not a decaying contact list.

## **Appendix: Investment Analysis**

### **The Opportunity Cost of Waiting**

**Every month of delay costs:**

1. Lost MRR due to lack of users  
2. 500+ users captured by emerging competitors (Dex, Clay, Folk)  
3. Market position as Personal CRM category crystallizes in 2025  
4. Acquisition window closing as LinkedIn/Salesforce build similar features

### **Payment Structure (Revised)**

#### **Option A: Success-Aligned Sprint Model**

**Fixed scope with milestone gates**

- **Phase 1:** SGD $18,000 (prove concept with 100 users)  
  - Stop here if not working \- minimal risk  
- **Phase 2:** SGD $18,000  
  - Viral mechanics must show 10x user growth  
- **Phase 3:** SGD $18,000  
  - 50% DAU proves stickiness  
- **Phase 4:** SGD $18,000  
  - Expansion.

**Total: SGD $72,000 if all milestones hit**

**Sprint Model Constraints:**

- **Scope locked:** Must define all features upfront for each phase  
- **Change requests:** Require contract amendments  
- **Learning limitations:** Can't pivot easily based on user feedback mid-sprint  
- **Discovery risk:** If requirements are unclear, may build wrong features

#### **Option B: Monthly Partnership Model (RECOMMENDED)**

**Best value for iterative product development**

- **SGD $8,500/month** with 6-month minimum commitment  
- **Total: SGD $68,000** for initial 8 months  
- **More development time:** \~22 working days/month vs 20 days per 2 sprints  
- **Flexibility:** Adjust priorities based on user feedback without contract changes

**True Cost Comparison:**

- **Sprint-based:** SGD $72,000 for 160 development days (16 sprints Ã— 10 days)  
  - **Cost per day:** SGD $450  
- **Monthly model:** SGD $68,000 for 176 development days (8 months Ã— 22 days)  
  - **Cost per day:** SGD $386

    
**You get:**

- 16 extra development days (10% more work)  
- SGD $4,000 absolute savings  
- 14% **lower daily rate** ($386 vs $450)  
- **Plus flexibility** to pivot based on learnings

**Why this is ideal for NoOn:**

- Current product needs iteration \= requirements will evolve  
- No scope lock-in \= pivot based on user feedback without contract changes  
- Can stop after 6 months if needed (SGD $51,000 total)  
- Can extend month-by-month based on results

### **Competitive Reality Check**

| Competitor | Funding | Valuation | Their Weakness | Our Advantage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Dex | $1.3M | $10M+ | Complex, tech-heavy | NoOn's simplicity \+ NFC entry |
| Clay | $8M | $50M+ | Enterprise focus | Personal use case focus |
| Folk | $3.5M | $25M+ | European market | Asia-Pacific opportunity |
| Monica CRM | Bootstrapped | $5M+ | Feature bloat | Focused on relationships only |

**Window:** 6-12 months before a major player dominates Personal CRM

---

### **Risk Mitigation**

**"What if it doesn't work?"**

**Worst Case:** Platform becomes a better contact manager

- Still improves current app (protecting existing revenue)  
- Features can be unbundled and sold separately  
- Technology assets (AI, crowdsourcing) have independent value

**Realistic Case:** Capture very small part of target market

- 3,500 users Ã— $9 \= SGD $31,500/month  
- **SGD $378,000 annual revenue**  
- 500+% ROI even in failure scenario

**Best Case:** Follow Dex/Clay trajectory

- 50,000 users in Year 2  
- Acquisition offers at 10x revenue  
- **SGD $5-10M exit potential**
