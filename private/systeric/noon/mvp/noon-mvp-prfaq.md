# NoOn MVP - Press Release FAQ

## Press Release

***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***

### **NoOn Ring: Share Your Contact in One Tap. No Typing. No Apps Required.**

*The smartest way to exchange contacts - just tap your ring to anyone's phone*

**Singapore** - NoOn today launches its MVP that makes business card exchanges obsolete. With a single tap of the NoOn ring to anyone's phone, your contact is instantly shared - no apps needed, no manual typing, no friction.

"We've all been there - pulling out phones, spelling out email addresses letter by letter, or worse, exchanging paper business cards that end up in a drawer," said [Founder Name], CEO of NoOn. "NoOn ring makes contact exchange feel like magic: tap once, done. Whether the other person has our app or not, they get your contact immediately."

**How It Works:**

When you tap your NoOn ring to someone's phone, their phone instantly opens a web page. If they have the NoOn app, it opens automatically and connects you both in seconds. If they don't have the app, WhatsApp opens with a pre-filled message - they tap send, and you get their contact instantly.

**The Result:** Contact exchange that takes 5-10 seconds, not 30.

Early beta user Michael Chen, a sales executive in Hong Kong, shared: "I met 40 people at a conference last week. With NoOn, I got all 40 contacts perfectly saved - no manual entry, no follow-up emails asking for info. It's absurdly simple."

**For NoOn Users:**
- Tap ring → instant connection
- Import all Google contacts on signup
- Share contacts with other NoOn users
- Keep your contact list organized in one place

**Coming Soon:**
- Auto-sync when contacts update their info
- Smart reminders to stay in touch
- AI-powered relationship insights

**Available starting today on iOS and Android. NoOn rings are available at noon.app for SGD $49.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **How does the ring work? Do I need NFC?**

The NoOn ring has an embedded NFC chip (the same technology in contactless payments). When you tap it to any modern smartphone (iPhone or Android with NFC), the phone reads the chip and opens a web link instantly - no app required.

**For the person tapping their ring (you):**
- No action needed after the tap
- You get notified when someone connects

**For the person receiving (them):**
- Phone vibrates/shows notification
- Browser opens automatically
- If they have NoOn app: App opens with connection request (1 tap to accept)
- If they don't have NoOn: Web page guides them to download (auto-redirects to App Store)

**Compatibility:**
- iPhone XS and newer (iOS 13+)
- Android phones with NFC (95% of Android phones since 2018)

**No NFC on their phone?**
- Show them the QR code in your NoOn app (same result)

---

### **What happens when someone taps my ring?**

It depends on whether they have NoOn installed:

#### **Scenario A: They have NoOn (Instant Connection)**

```
1. You tap ring to their phone (1 second)
2. Their NoOn app opens automatically (2 seconds)
3. Shows: "[Your Name] wants to connect"
4. They tap "Connect" (1 tap)
5. Done! You both have each other as contacts (with full info)

Total time: 5 seconds
```

You both get a notification: "You're now connected with [Name]"

#### **Scenario B: They don't have NoOn (WhatsApp Connection)**

```
1. You tap ring to their phone
2. WhatsApp opens automatically with pre-filled message to NoOn gateway
3. They tap send (or modify message and send)
4. You get notification: "Someone tapped your ring: +65 XXXX XXXX"
5. You can save their number or reach out via WhatsApp
6. They get WhatsApp reply: "[Your Name] wants to connect! Download NoOn: [link]"

Total time: 10 seconds
```

**If they download NoOn later:**
- The download link includes your referral code
- When they sign up, you're automatically connected
- Both get notified: "You're now connected!"

**The key insight:** Zero friction. If they have the app, instant connection. If not, WhatsApp captures the connection.

---

### **What if I don't have a ring yet? Can I still use NoOn?**

Absolutely! The ring is optional (but highly recommended for the magic experience).

**Without a ring, you can:**
1. Show your QR code in the app → they scan it (same flow as ring tap)
2. Share your profile link via text/email → they click it
3. Import contacts from Google and connect with existing NoOn users
4. Share contacts with other NoOn users directly in the app

**With a ring:** Everything is just faster. One tap vs pulling out your phone, opening app, showing QR code.

**Ring purchase:** SGD $49 at noon.app. Comes pre-programmed with your unique profile link.

### **How does contact import work during onboarding?**

We make it **ridiculously easy** to get started:

#### **Onboarding Flow (Takes 2 minutes)**

```
Step 1: Sign in with Google (10 seconds)
→ Tap "Sign in with Google"
→ Done! Your basic profile is created

Step 2: Import contacts (30 seconds)
→ Tap "Import Google Contacts"
→ Grant permission
→ NoOn imports all your contacts automatically

Step 3: Discover NoOn users (10 seconds)
→ NoOn checks which of your contacts are already users
→ Shows: "12 of your contacts use NoOn!"
→ Tap "Connect All" to auto-connect with them
→ They get notifications, can accept instantly

Step 4: You're done! (1 minute)
→ See your contact list (synced from Google)
→ NoOn users are marked with a blue badge
→ Start tapping your ring to add more contacts
```

**What gets imported:**
- Names, phone numbers, emails
- Profile photos (if available)
- No sensitive data or message history

**Privacy:**
- Your contacts are encrypted and private
- We don't spam your contacts
- You can delete all data anytime

---

### **What's the "contact sharing" feature?**

Sometimes you want to introduce two people in your network. NoOn makes this seamless.

#### **How to Share a Contact:**

```
1. Open a contact (e.g., "David Chen")
2. Tap "Share Contact"
3. Select recipient from your NoOn contacts (e.g., "Sarah Lee")
4. Add optional note: "Sarah, meet David! He's great at product design."
5. Tap Send

Sarah receives:
→ Push notification: "[Your Name] shared a contact with you"
→ Opens app → sees David's full profile
→ Can tap "Connect" to send David a connection request
→ David accepts → they're connected
```

**Use cases:**
- Introducing clients to vendors
- Connecting job seekers with hiring managers
- Facilitating investor-founder intros
- Helping friends expand their networks

**Privacy:**
- Both parties are notified
- Recipient must send connection request (no auto-connect)
- Original contact (David) can decline

---

### **How is NoOn different from LinkedIn or other contact apps?**

NoOn is focused on **contact exchange and maintenance**, not professional networking or job hunting.

| Feature | NoOn | LinkedIn | Apple Contacts | Rypple/HiHello |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Physical contact exchange** | ✅ Ring tap (NFC) | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ✅ Card tap/QR |
| **Import existing contacts** | ✅ One-tap Google import | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Manual |
| **Auto-update contacts** | ✅ Coming soon | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Contact sharing** | ✅ One tap | ❌ | ❌ Share vCard | ✅ |
| **No app required (for receiver)** | ✅ Web fallback | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ Requires app |
| **Works with non-users** | ✅ WhatsApp fallback | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**LinkedIn:** Professional network, job hunting, content platform. NoOn is just contacts - simpler, faster, private.

**Apple Contacts/Google Contacts:** Static storage. NoOn actively maintains relationships (auto-updates, reminders coming in future versions).

**Digital business card apps:** Require both parties to have the app. NoOn works even if the other person doesn't have it (via WhatsApp fallback).

---

### **What about privacy? Who can see my contact info?**

Privacy is core to NoOn's design:

**What's visible when someone taps your ring:**
- Name, profile photo, headline (e.g., "Product Manager at Google")
- NO phone number, NO email until you're connected

**After connection:**
- They see the info you choose to share (phone, email, social links)
- You control what's visible in Settings → Profile Privacy

**Your Google contacts:**
- Stored encrypted
- Only visible to you
- Never shared with other users or advertisers
- NoOn doesn't access your messages or call history

**Connection data:**
- When you connect with someone, only metadata is shared:
  - "Connected via ring tap on [date]"
- No private info shared without explicit consent

**Data export & deletion:**
- Export all your data anytime: Settings → Export Data
- Delete your account: Settings → Delete Account → All data erased within 24 hours

**No ads, no data selling:**
- NoOn's business model is hardware (rings) and future premium features
- We never sell your data
- No targeted advertising

---

### **What if I change my phone number or email? Do my contacts get updated?**

**For MVP:** Manual updates only.

**Coming soon (Phase 2):** Auto-update network effect.

#### **How Auto-Update Will Work:**

```
Scenario: You change jobs from Google to Meta

1. You update your profile in NoOn:
   → New company: "Meta"
   → New title: "Senior Product Manager"
   → New email: "you@meta.com"

2. NoOn notifies your connections:
   → Push notification: "[Your Name] updated their profile"
   → They open app → see updated info
   → One-tap to save new email/number

3. Crowdsourced intelligence (privacy-preserving):
   → If multiple people mark you at "Meta", NoOn suggests this update
   → You confirm or dismiss
   → Your connections get notified
```

**Privacy:** Only connection changes are shared, not personal details. If you change your phone number, contacts get notified to "update contact info" but don't see the new number until you share it.

---

### **Does continuous contact sync mean my Google contacts update automatically?**

**For MVP:** One-time import only on signup.

**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):** Continuous sync.

#### **How Continuous Sync Will Work:**

```
After initial import:
→ NoOn requests "background sync" permission
→ Every 24 hours, syncs changes from Google Contacts:
  • New contacts added → imported to NoOn
  • Contact updated → changes reflected in NoOn
  • Contact deleted → marked as deleted (not auto-deleted for safety)

You can:
→ Turn off sync anytime
→ Manually sync: Pull down on contacts list
→ See last sync time in Settings
```

**Why continuous sync matters:**
- You add someone's number in Google Contacts → automatically in NoOn
- Someone updates their info in your phone → NoOn reflects it
- Keep one source of truth (Google Contacts) + NoOn's smart features

**Privacy:** NoOn only syncs contact info (name, phone, email), not messages, calls, or location.

---

### **What's the technology behind the ring?**

The NoOn ring contains:
- **NFC chip (NTAG216):** Same technology as contactless payments
- **Unique encrypted URL:** Points to your profile (e.g., noon.app/t/abc123xyz)
- **No battery required:** Powered by the phone's NFC field when you tap
- **Waterproof:** IP68 rating, wear it 24/7
- **Durable:** Ceramic/titanium material, scratch-resistant

**How programming works:**
1. You order a ring at noon.app
2. During signup, you link your ring to your account
3. Ring's NFC chip is programmed with your unique URL
4. URL never changes, even if you update your profile

**Can I have multiple rings?**
Yes! Link up to 5 rings to your account (e.g., different fingers, backup ring). All point to the same profile.

**What if I lose my ring?**
- Deactivate it in app: Settings → Rings → Deactivate
- Order a new one, link to your account
- Old ring becomes inactive (can't be used to connect)

---

### **How do I know if someone tapped my ring?**

You get **real-time notifications** for every ring tap:

**Notification types:**

1. **Connected with NoOn user:**
   - "You're now connected with Sarah Chen!"
   - Tap to open profile

2. **Someone viewed your profile (non-user):**
   - "Someone viewed your NoOn profile"
   - Tap to see timestamp and location (if available)

3. **WhatsApp connection request:**
   - "Someone wants to connect: +65 9876 5432"
   - Tap to save contact or send WhatsApp message

**Analytics (in app):**
- See how many people tapped your ring today/this week
- View conversion rate (taps → downloads)
- Coming soon: See where your ring is most effective (conferences, meetings, etc.)

---

### **What happens if the other person modifies the WhatsApp message before sending?**

**Short answer:** It still works, as long as they don't delete the code.

**How it works:**

The pre-filled WhatsApp message contains a code: `Code: abc123xyz`

Our backend extracts this code from the message body, even if the rest is modified.

**Examples that work:**

```
Original: "Hi NoOn! Connect me with John. Code: abc123xyz"

Modified to: "Hey! Code: abc123xyz"
→ ✅ Works! Backend extracts code, creates connection

Modified to: "Hello, this is Michael. Code: abc123xyz. Looking forward to connecting!"
→ ✅ Works! Code is present, connection created

Modified to: "Hi NoOn! Code: abc123xyz Connect me with John"
→ ✅ Works! Order doesn't matter
```

**Examples that DON'T work:**

```
Modified to: "Hi NoOn! Connect me with John."
→ ❌ Code deleted, backend can't identify User A

Modified to: "Code: abc123WRONG"
→ ❌ Code tampered with, backend rejects
```

**What happens if code is missing/invalid:**
- NoOn WhatsApp replies: "Oops! We couldn't process this connection. Please tap the ring again."
- No harm done, user can retry

**Why allow modifications:**
- Some users want to personalize the message
- Cultural differences (some prefer formal, others casual)
- Users might add context: "We met at TechCon 2025"

**Backend is smart:** It uses regex pattern matching to find the code anywhere in the message.

### **Why WhatsApp and not SMS or email?**

**WhatsApp is the default** in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia):
- 98% smartphone penetration
- Used by all age groups
- Reliable delivery
- No SMS costs
- Rich media support (future: send profile cards)

**For markets where WhatsApp isn't dominant:**
- US: SMS fallback (using Twilio)
- China: WeChat fallback (future)
- Japan: LINE fallback (future)

**MVP focuses on Southeast Asia**, where WhatsApp is universal.

**Why not email:**
- Slower (people check less frequently)
- Spam filters
- Less personal for quick connections

**Why not SMS:**
- Costs per message
- No delivery confirmation
- Can't send rich media
- WhatsApp is free and more reliable in Asia
