## How to Set This Up

**Step 1: Block Sunday for setup (1 hour)**
Create all these calendar events in one session. Don't do it piecemeal.

**Step 2: Use calendar colors**
- Purple: Spiritual (Bible, church, community)
- Green: Physical (workout, cleaning)
- Blue: Personal (haircut, laundry)
- Orange: Financial/Admin (budget, expenses, reviews)
- Red: Non-negotiable (don't move these)

**Step 3: Treat them like meetings**
Don't skip. Don't reschedule unless emergency. These are meetings with yourself.

**Step 4: Set "Focus Time" blocks**
- Bible reading: Phone on Do Not Disturb
- Deep Work: Phone off, no Slack, no meetings
- Workout: Phone in locker
- Church: Phone on silent

**Step 5: Link habits together (habit stacking)**
- Bible → Workout → Make bed + Prayer (morning routine)
- Kitchen clean → Clutter pickup → Journal → Expenses (night routine)
- Vacuum → Bathroom → Laundry (Sunday cleaning block)

## Automation Tips

**Don't rely on memory:**
- Gym bag packed the night before (set reminder at 9pm)
- Bible on nightstand before bed
- Expense tracking app on phone home screen
- Car wash place in Google Maps favorites

**Reduce friction:**
- Pre-schedule haircut appointments (book next one when you finish current one)
- Autopay all bills
- Workout clothes laid out Saturday night for Sunday-Monday

**Use technology:**
- Screen Time limits for social media (30min/day)
- Shortcuts app: "End of Day" routine (kitchen + journal + expenses)
- Calendar notifications on Apple Watch/phone

**Accountability:**
- Share workout calendar with friend
- Join church small group that meets same time weekly
- Put budget review on shared calendar if married/partnered

## When Calendar Events Don't Work

**If you keep missing a habit:**
1. Is the time wrong? (6am Bible but you wake up at 7am = won't work)
2. Is the frequency too high? (4x workout but you can only do 3x = adjust)
3. Is there too much friction? (Gym 30min away = move closer or switch gyms)

**Don't fight the system - fix the system.**

If you miss a calendar event 3 weeks in a row, don't feel guilty. Change the habit or change the time.

---

## TL;DR

Set up recurring calendar events for every habit. Treat them like meetings. Don't skip. If you keep missing one, change the time or the habit.
