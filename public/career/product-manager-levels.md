## Product Manager Levels

**How to use this doc:**

This is your roadmap. Find your current level, understand what's expected, and see what it takes to reach the next one. Use this when setting quarterly goals.

## How to Use This for Career Growth

**At quarterly 1:1s:**
1. Identify your current level
2. Pick 2-3 things from "Path to Next Level"
3. Make them your quarterly goals
4. Track progress in biweekly 1:1s

**Example: IC1 wanting to reach IC2**

Current level: IC1 - shipping features, understanding users, executing reliably

Path to IC2:
1. Own a product area (not just features)
2. Drive metric improvement
3. Influence roadmap

**Quarterly goal:**
"Own onboarding product area end-to-end. Ship 3 initiatives that increase activation from 60% to 75%. Propose and get buy-in for mobile app onboarding (wasn't on roadmap)."

## Common Questions

**"I do some things at the next level. Does that mean I should be promoted?"**

No. You need to operate consistently at the next level for 2-3 quarters before promotion. Shipping one senior-level project doesn't make you a senior PM.

**"I've been at this level for 2 years. When do I get promoted?"**

When you consistently demonstrate next-level impact. Time doesn't earn promotions - outcomes do. Use "Path to Next Level" to focus your efforts.

**"What if I don't want to manage people?"**

IC track goes to IC4 (Principal PM). You can have massive impact without managing. IC3/IC4 PMs often have more product impact than managers.

**"Can I go from IC to Manager and back?"**

Yes. Management is a role change, not a promotion. IC3 and M2 are roughly equivalent in seniority.

**"What's the difference between IC3 and IC4?"**

IC3 drives multi-product strategy. IC4 sets company-wide product direction. IC4 is rare - you're shaping what the entire company builds.

---

## Product Manager vs. Product Leader

**IC0-IC1 (PM):** You ship features. You solve user problems. You execute.

**IC2-IC3 (Product Leader):** You set strategy. You drive business outcomes. You influence.

**IC4 (Product Visionary):** You define what the company builds. You shape markets.

**Manager Track:** You multiply impact through people. You build product orgs.

The transition from IC1 → IC2 is the hardest. You go from "ship this feature" to "what should we build and why?" Use your quarterly 1:1s to build that muscle.
