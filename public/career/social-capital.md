# Social Capital

Your ability to get things done comes from trust and relationships, not just your job title.

---

## TL;DR

- **Motives matter:** Social capital built inauthentically is manipulation. Under stress, your true character shows
- **Social capital = trust + credibility + relationships** - It's the currency that lets you influence without authority
- **Build it through deposits:** Ship reliably, help others, surface risks early, communicate clearly
- **Spend it wisely:** Urgent approvals, risky initiatives, asking for resources
- **Track it weekly:** Are people responding slower? Getting fewer invites? That's depletion
- **Compounds over time:** Junior → prove yourself. Mid → widen influence. Senior → cross-org alliances

## Motives Matter: Social Capital vs Manipulation

**Before you read this article, understand this: Social capital built inauthentically is manipulation.**

These tactics only work if they're genuine personality traits and values. Under stress, your true character shows. If you're faking it, people will notice.

### The Critical Difference

| Social Capital (Authentic) | Manipulation (Fake) |
|---|---|
| You help because you want to | You help to get something back |
| You're consistent under stress | You revert to real self under pressure |
| You care about others' success | You only care about your success |
| Built over years, part of who you are | Engineered tactics, feels performative |
| People trust you in crisis | People question your motives in crisis |

### The Stress Test

**Under pressure, who are you really?**

**Authentic:**
- Project fails → You own your part, help the team recover
- Someone gets promoted instead of you → You're genuinely happy for them
- Person asks for help when you're busy → You actually want to help

**Manipulative:**
- Project fails → You blame others, protect yourself
- Someone gets promoted instead of you → You resent them, talk behind their back
- Person asks for help when you're busy → You help resentfully and keep score

**If the tactics in this article don't match your actual values, don't use them. They'll backfire.**

### Who Should Read This

**Read this if:**
- You genuinely want to help others succeed
- You care about team outcomes, not just personal wins
- You follow through on commitments naturally
- You're comfortable celebrating others

**Don't read this if:**
- You're looking for tactics to manipulate people
- You only care about yourself
- You want shortcuts without doing the work
- You're transactional (I'll help if you help me)

**The tactics work because they amplify authenticity, not create it.**

If you're not naturally helpful, reliable, and collaborative, work on those traits first. This article won't help you fake it.

## What Is Social Capital

**Social capital is your ability to get things done through trust and relationships.**

It's not:
- Your job title
- How many reports you have
- Your years of experience

It's:
- Whether people trust you to deliver
- Whether they believe what you say
- Whether they want to help you

**Example:**
- Engineer with low social capital: "We should migrate to Postgres." → Ignored
- Same engineer with high social capital: "We should migrate to Postgres. Here's data from 3 teams who did it." → Gets eng leadership meeting in 2 days

The difference isn't the idea. It's the capital.

## The Three Pillars

Social capital has three components. You need all three.

### 1. Trust

**Do what you say you'll do.**

**How to build trust:**
- Ship on time. If you can't, say so early (not the day before)
- Surface risks before they become problems ("This might slip 2 days" beats silence)
- Own mistakes. "I missed this in review" beats "The test suite didn't catch it"

**Example:**
- Low trust: "I'll have it done Friday" → Ships Monday with bugs
- High trust: "I'll have it done Friday. If I hit blockers, I'll flag by Wednesday" → Ships Friday or flags Wednesday

### 2. Credibility

**People believe you know what you're talking about.**

**How to build credibility:**
- Pair execution with communication: Ship the feature + write the doc
- Learn continuously: "I researched how Stripe does this" beats "I think we should..."
- Be right more often than wrong: Track your predictions, improve your accuracy

**Example:**
- Low credibility: "This will scale fine" → Breaks at 10K users
- High credibility: "This will scale to 100K users based on load tests. Here's the data" → Scales as predicted

### 3. Relationships

**People want to help you.**

**How to build relationships:**
- Help without keeping score: Review code for other teams, answer questions in Slack
- Celebrate others: "Sarah's design made this 10x better" in standups
- Build cross-team rapport: Virtual coffee with that PM you've never met

**Example:**
- Weak relationships: Need urgent review → Crickets
- Strong relationships: Need urgent review → "On it. Will have it back in 30 min"

## How to Build Social Capital

### Micro-Habits

Small actions that build social capital. Pick what fits your style.

**Share wins and credit others**
- Post in Slack: "Shipped checkout v2. Conversion up 12%. Thanks to @sarah for designs"
- Credit others explicitly
- Builds relationships through recognition

**Review code outside your team**
- Find a PR from a team you don't work with
- Leave thoughtful feedback
- Builds trust across org

**Virtual coffee with new people**
- 15-minute call with someone you've never met
- Ask about their work, offer to help
- Builds relationships cross-functionally

**Document what you learn**
- Write what you learned this week
- Post to team wiki or Slack
- Builds credibility (shows continuous learning)

**Thank people publicly**
- Slack post: "Thanks to @mike for unblocking me on the API design"
- Public recognition strengthens relationships
- Be specific about what they did

**Help without being asked**
- Answer questions in team Slack even if not directed at you
- Offer to pair when you see someone stuck
- Builds reputation as helpful

**Surface problems early**
- "This might slip 2 days, here's why"
- Don't wait until deadline to flag issues
- Builds trust through transparency

**Time per action:** 5-10 minutes
**Frequency:** Whatever you can sustain (daily, weekly, whatever works)
**Payoff:** Compounds over 3-6 months

### Career Stage Strategy

What to focus on based on your level:

**Junior (IC0-IC1): Prove yourself**
- Deposits: Ship reliably, ask good questions, own your mistakes
- Avoid: Overpromising, blaming others, going dark
- Goal: "I trust them to deliver what they say"

**Mid-level (IC2-IC3): Widen influence**
- Deposits: Help other teams, share knowledge, lead small projects
- Avoid: Hoarding information, staying in your bubble
- Goal: "They make the whole team better"

**Senior (IC4): Build cross-org alliances**
- Deposits: Solve other teams' problems, influence architecture, mentor broadly
- Avoid: Being a lone wolf, optimizing only your team
- Goal: "They make the whole org better"

**Staff+ (IC5+): Multiply through others**
- Deposits: Unblock multiple teams, set technical direction, grow future leaders
- Avoid: Doing IC work that doesn't scale
- Goal: "They enable 10 engineers to do their best work"

**Manager: Amplify your team**
- Deposits: Get resources for team, surface their wins, remove blockers
- Avoid: Taking credit, protecting territory
- Goal: "My team's success is my success"

## How to Spend Social Capital

Social capital is a bank account. You deposit through trust, credibility, and relationships. You withdraw when you need something.

### Good Withdrawals

**1. Urgent approvals**
- "I need design approval by EOD to ship tomorrow"
- Cost: Medium (asking people to drop everything)
- When it works: You've shipped reliably before

**2. Risky initiatives**
- "Let's migrate to Postgres. It'll take 6 weeks and might break things"
- Cost: High (asking for trust on uncertain bet)
- When it works: You've surfaced risks honestly and been right before

**3. Extra resources**
- "I need 2 more engineers to hit this deadline"
- Cost: High (asking for budget/headcount)
- When it works: You've proven ROI on previous asks

**4. Forgiveness for mistakes**
- "I broke prod. Here's what happened and how I'm fixing it"
- Cost: Medium (using trust you've built)
- When it works: You own it, fix it, and don't repeat it

### Bad Withdrawals

**Don't spend social capital on:**
- ❌ Complaining without solutions
- ❌ Defending work that's clearly wrong
- ❌ Asking for favors you could solve yourself
- ❌ Politics or gossip

**These withdrawals don't get you results. They just drain your account.**

## Warning Signs of Depletion

You're running low on social capital if:

**1. Slower responses**
- Your Slack messages used to get replies in 10 minutes
- Now they take 2+ hours
- Signal: People are deprioritizing you

**2. Fewer invitations**
- You used to be in architecture meetings
- Now you're finding out about decisions after they're made
- Signal: People don't value your input

**3. More "let me think about it"**
- People used to say yes to your asks quickly
- Now it's "I'll get back to you" (and they don't)
- Signal: They don't trust you'll deliver value

**4. Help becomes transactional**
- "I'll review your PR if you review mine"
- Used to be: "Happy to help"
- Signal: Relationship is weakening

**What to do:**
1. Stop withdrawing. No more asks for 2-4 weeks
2. Make deposits. Ship something great, help 5 people, document something useful
3. Rebuild slowly. It takes 3 months to recover from depletion

## Agency + Social Capital Matrix

Your impact comes from combining **agency** (ability to make things happen) with **social capital** (relationships to make it happen).

| | Low Social Capital | High Social Capital |
|---|---|---|
| **High Agency** | **Lone Wolf** - Great ideas, no support. Changes happen slowly or not at all. | **Org-Changing Force** - Great ideas + people want to help. Changes happen fast. |
| **Low Agency** | **Stuck** - No ideas, no relationships. Low impact. | **Reliable Partner** - No ideas, but people like working with you. Solid IC, limited ceiling. |

**Where you want to be:** High agency + high social capital = org-changing force

**Example:**
- Lone wolf: "We should rewrite the API" → Ignored because no allies
- Org-changing force: "We should rewrite the API. I talked to 3 teams, here's data, and I have buy-in from eng leadership" → Gets funded and staffed

**How to move:**
- Stuck → Reliable partner: Build relationships (help others, show up consistently)
- Lone wolf → Org-changing force: Build social capital (share your work, build allies)
- Reliable partner → Org-changing force: Build agency (propose ideas, take initiative)

## Social Capital vs Favoritism

**Social capital is earned. Favoritism is given.**

| Social Capital | Favoritism |
|---|---|
| Earned through visible contributions | Given based on personal relationships |
| Benefits the team and org | Benefits individuals |
| Others can see why you have influence | Others question why you have influence |
| Creates mutual benefit | Creates resentment |
| Open to anyone who does the work | Limited to "in-group" |

**Test:** If you left tomorrow, would people miss your contributions or just your friendship?

**Example:**
- Social capital: "Alex always ships on time and helps other teams. They deserve that promotion"
- Favoritism: "Alex is my friend. They should get that promotion"

**Red flags you're benefiting from favoritism, not social capital:**
- People question why you have influence
- You get special treatment others don't
- Your failures are excused, others' aren't
- You're in meetings you don't contribute to

**If you notice this:** Earn your spot. Ship visibly, help broadly, communicate clearly.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Building social capital with only your manager

**Bad:** Only your manager trusts you
**Good:** 10+ people across 3 teams trust you

**Why it matters:** Your manager might leave. Your capital leaves with them.

**Fix:** Help other teams, build relationships cross-functionally.

### Mistake 2: Withdrawing before depositing

**Bad:** First week on team → "We should rewrite everything"
**Good:** First 3 months → Ship reliably, help others → Then propose big changes

**Why it matters:** You have no capital to spend yet.

**Fix:** Deposit for 3-6 months before making big asks.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the compound effect

**Bad:** "I'll build relationships when I need something"
**Good:** "I'll build relationships now so I have capital when I need it"

**Why it matters:** Social capital takes 3-6 months to compound. You can't build it overnight.

**Fix:** Weekly micro-habits (see above). Do them every week.

### Mistake 4: Optimizing for visibility over value

**Bad:** Posting in Slack constantly about minor wins
**Good:** Ship meaningful work, then share it

**Why it matters:** Visibility without value is noise. Value without visibility is missed opportunity. You need both.

**Fix:** Ship first, share second. Not the other way around.

## Action: Start Building Social Capital

Pick 2-3 micro-habits from the list above that feel natural to you. Do them consistently.

**Examples to start with:**

**If you're good at shipping:**
- Share what you shipped and credit others who helped
- Surface problems early instead of hiding them

**If you're good at helping:**
- Review code outside your team
- Answer questions in Slack proactively

**If you're good at connecting:**
- Schedule virtual coffees with new people
- Thank people publicly for helping you

**If you're good at learning:**
- Document what you learn and share it
- Write postmortems that teach others

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes per action
**Frequency:** Whatever you can sustain (daily, few times a week, weekly)

**Expected result in 3 months:**
- People respond to your messages faster
- You get invited to more meetings
- People say yes to your asks more often

**That's social capital compounding.**
