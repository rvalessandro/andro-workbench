## Software Engineer Levels

**How to use this doc:**

This is your roadmap. Find your current level, understand what's expected, and see what it takes to reach the next one. Use this when setting quarterly goals.

Every level builds on the previous one. You don't lose skills as you level up - you add new ones.

## How to Use This for Career Growth

**At quarterly 1:1s:**
1. Identify your current level
2. Pick 2-3 things from "Path to Next Level"
3. Make them your quarterly goals
4. Track progress in biweekly 1:1s

**Example: IC1 wanting to reach IC2**

Current level: IC1 - shipping features reliably, need guidance on approach

Path to IC2:
1. Own a feature from spec to launch (no hand-holding)
2. Debug production issues independently
3. Mentor an intern

**Quarterly goal:**
"Ship notification system from design to production independently. Handle 5 production incidents without escalating. Mentor intern on coding best practices (pair 2hrs/week)."

---

## Common Questions

**"I do some things at the next level. Does that mean I should be promoted?"**

No. You need to operate consistently at the next level for 2-3 quarters before promotion. Doing senior work once doesn't make you a senior.

**"I've been at this level for 2 years. When do I get promoted?"**

When you consistently demonstrate next-level impact. Time doesn't earn promotions - growth does. Use "Path to Next Level" to focus your efforts.

**"What if I don't want to manage people?"**

IC track goes to IC4 (and beyond at larger companies: Staff, Principal, Distinguished). You can have massive impact without managing.

**"Can I go from IC to Manager and back?"**

Yes. Management is a role change, not a promotion. IC4 and M2 are roughly equivalent in seniority.

## TL;DR

- **IC0-IC1:** Learn to ship reliably
- **IC2:** Own problems end-to-end
- **IC3:** Drive business impact
- **IC4:** Set technical direction
- **M1-M3:** Multiply through people

Find your level. Focus on 2-3 things from "Path to Next Level". Set quarterly goals. Execute.
