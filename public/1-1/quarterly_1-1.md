## Quarterly 1:1

**What this is for:**

Every quarter, we sit down and get clear on what you want to achieve and how to make it happen. This doc is your plan.

Three months from now, what will you have built? What will you have learned? What will you be able to do that you can't do today? Write that down here. Be specific - the more concrete you are, the easier it is to know if you succeeded.

This isn't about making promises you can't keep. It's about painting a picture of success and working backward to figure out how to get there. Start with where you want to be, then map the path.

**How to think about it:**

Great goals are specific enough that you'll know without question whether you hit them. "Ship the new payment system" beats "work on payments". "Launch user research program with 20 interviews" beats "do more research". "Reduce design revision cycles from 5 to 2" beats "improve design quality".

Each goal should pass the dinner table test: if you told a friend at dinner what you accomplished this quarter, would they understand why it mattered? "I launched a feature that increased conversion by 15%" lands. "I improved my work" doesn't.

Career development is the same. Don't write "become better at my job" - write what you'll be able to do. Run a design critique with 10 people. Lead product discovery without your manager. Present roadmap to executives. Ship a feature end-to-end. The more specific, the more useful.

Read the examples below to see what this looks like in practice.

### **Goals**

Pick 3 things that, if you nail them, make this quarter a win. What will exist at the end that doesn't exist now?

Think: shipped features, numbers that moved, capabilities you unlocked, problems you solved.

Examples of strong goals:
- "Ship payments v2 to production handling 100% of transactions" (not "work on payments")
- "Launch design system with 15 components adopted by 3 teams" (not "improve design consistency")
- "Run 20 user interviews and ship 2 validated product bets" (not "do more research")
- "Reduce feature spec revision rounds from 4 to 1" (not "write better specs")
- "Hire 2 senior engineers with start dates before Q3" (not "help with hiring")

1. **Goal:** One liner - verb + noun + outcome
   - **Why it matters:** Business or team impact in one sentence
   - **Success looks like:** Number, shipped thing, or observable change

2. **Goal:** One liner - verb + noun + outcome
   - **Why it matters:** Business or team impact in one sentence
   - **Success looks like:** Number, shipped thing, or observable change

3. **Goal:** One liner - verb + noun + outcome
   - **Why it matters:** Business or team impact in one sentence
   - **Success looks like:** Number, shipped thing, or observable change

### **Actions This Quarter**

For each goal, break it into steps. What happens in month 1? Month 2? Month 3?

Be specific - use dates, numbers, milestones. "Ship X by Week 4" beats "work on X". "Reduce from 800ms to 200ms by Month 2" beats "improve performance". If you can't break it down, the goal might not be concrete enough.

**Goal 1:**
- Action 1 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 2 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 3 (Week X-Y or Month)

**Goal 2:**
- Action 1 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 2 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 3 (Week X-Y or Month)

**Goal 3:**
- Action 1 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 2 (Week X-Y or Month)
- Action 3 (Week X-Y or Month)

### **Support Needed**

What do you need from me to make this happen? Be direct. "Budget approval for $5K Redis" is useful. "More support" is not.

### **Career Development**

By the end of this quarter, what will you be able to do that you can't do today?

Don't write "get better at X". Write the thing you'll do that proves you got better. "Run design critique for 10 people without help" beats "improve leadership". "Present product strategy to executives" beats "improve communication". "Ship a feature end-to-end as DRI" beats "take more ownership". "Debug production issues in 30 minutes" beats "learn debugging".

Think: if you had this capability today, what would you do differently tomorrow?

- **By end of quarter, I will be able to:** Specific capability you'll have
- **How I'll build it:** The project, training, or practice that gets me there
- **How we'll know it worked:** What I'll ship or do that proves I have this capability

## Example 2: Product Manager

**Quarter:** Q2 2024
**Person:** Maria Santos

### **Goals**

1. **Goal:** Launch checkout redesign that increases conversion from 8% to 12%
   - **Why it matters:** Each 1% improvement = $500K annual revenue
   - **Success looks like:** New checkout live, 12%+ conversion sustained for 2 weeks post-launch

2. **Goal:** Build user research practice - run 20 interviews and validate 2 product bets
   - **Why it matters:** Current roadmap based on gut feel, not customer insight
   - **Success looks like:** 20 interviews completed, 2 features specced and prioritized from research findings

3. **Goal:** Reduce feature spec revision rounds from 4+ to 1-2
   - **Why it matters:** Specs taking 3 weeks means we ship 40% slower than competitors
   - **Success looks like:** 80% of specs approved in â‰¤2 rounds, measured across 10 specs

### **Actions This Quarter**

**Goal 1:**
- Run A/B test on current checkout to establish baseline (Week 1-2)
- Ship redesign to 10% of users (Week 3-4)
- Ramp to 50% and monitor metrics (Week 5-6)
- Full rollout if metrics hold (Week 7-8)

**Goal 2:**
- Recruit 20 users for interviews (Week 1-2)
- Conduct interviews, 5 per week (Week 3-6)
- Synthesize findings into 3 product bets (Week 7-8)
- Write specs for top 2 bets, get eng buy-in (Week 9-10)

**Goal 3:**
- Review last 10 specs to identify common revision patterns (Week 1)
- Create spec template with eng/design checklist (Week 2)
- Use template on every spec going forward (Week 3+)
- Monthly review with team on spec quality trends

### **Support Needed**

- Design resources for checkout redesign (4 weeks of dedicated designer time)
- Budget for user research incentives ($100 x 20 = $2K)
- Engineering lead to review spec template and provide feedback (2 hours in Week 2)

### **Career Development**

- **By end of quarter, I will be able to:** Run end-to-end product discovery and ship features without manager review at every step
- **How I'll build it:** Own checkout redesign from research to launch, run 20 user interviews, present findings to exec team, ship feature and measure impact
- **How we'll know it worked:** Checkout feature shipped with >12% conversion, manager didn't need to step in at any stage, exec team approved research findings

## Example 3: Junior Engineer

**Quarter:** Q3 2024
**Person:** Jamie Rodriguez

### **Goals**

1. **Goal:** Ship user notification system end-to-end without senior engineer pair programming

   - **Success looks like:** Notifications live in production, zero P0 bugs for 2 weeks post-launch

2. **Goal:** Reduce my PR revision cycles from 4+ rounds to 1-2 rounds
   - **Why it matters:** Currently blocking team velocity - my PRs take 3x longer than other engineers
   - **Success looks like:** 80% of my PRs approved in 2 rounds or less (measured over 20 PRs)

3. **Goal:** Debug production issues without escalating to senior engineers
   - **Why it matters:** Currently wake up seniors for issues I should handle, makes me unreliable for on-call
