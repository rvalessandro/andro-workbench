## Begin with the End in Mind

**What it is:** Start with the outcome, work backwards. Paint the picture of success before you build.

**How to use it:**
1. Paint a picture: What does success look like? Be specific.
2. Write it down: Press release, FAQ, dinner story, demo video
3. Work backwards: What needs to be true to get there?
4. If you can't write a compelling story, don't build it

**Example - PR/FAQ:**
```
"Today we launched instant transfers. Send money in 2 seconds, not 2 days.
Zero fees. Works 24/7."

FAQ:
Q: How is this different from competitors?
A: [If you can't answer this compellingly, don't build it]
```

**Example - Customer Story:**
- Bad: "We'll improve conversion"
- Good: "Sarah sends $50. Done in 8 seconds. Friend texts back: 'Already here!'"

**Reference:** [Working Backwards PR/FAQ Process](https://workingbackwards.com/concepts/working-backwards-pr-faq-process/)

**Why it matters:** Prevents investing in things that don't matter. Makes success tangible.

**When to use:** Every project, every quarter, every major decision.

## WTF per Minute

**What it is:** Track every moment of confusion, frustration, or "WTF?" Keep a notebook.

**The insight:** Best organizations, codebases, and products have the lowest WTF per minute. Low friction = high performance.

**How to use it:**
- Keep a WTF notebook (physical or digital), write things down with date and context.
- Review weekly: What patterns emerge? What's the action plan?

**Example:**
- "WTF - Why does deploy take 45 minutes? (Jan 5)"
- "WTF - Why do I need 3 approvals for $50 expense? (Jan 7)"
- "WTF - Why is this API response format inconsistent? (Jan 10)"
- Pattern: Process friction. Fix: Automate deploys, raise approval threshold to $500, standardize API responses.

**Why it matters:** Friction compounds. Every WTF wastes time, energy, and morale. Reduce WTFs, increase velocity.

**When to use:** Daily. Make it a habit. Best teams review WTFs in retrospectives.

## Compound Yourself

**What it is:** Seek exponential growth, not linear.

**How to use it:**
- Each project should teach you something that makes the next one easier
- Build leverage: code, media, people, reputation
- Ask: "Will this 10x my output in 2 years?"

**Example:**
- Bad: Consulting gig pays $200/hr but teaches you nothing
- Good: Build a product for $0/hr that teaches you to scale

**When to use:** Choosing what to work on.

---

## Have Self-Belief

**What it is:** Believe you can do hard things, even when others doubt.

**How to use it:**
- If everyone agrees, you're too late
- Trust yourself on big bets
- Stay open to feedback on execution

**Example:**
"Everyone said instant transfers are impossible with our stack. Built it anyway in 4 days."

**When to use:** Taking on ambitious challenges.

---

## Think Independently

**What it is:** Test ideas yourself. Don't follow consensus.

**How to use it:**
- Ask: "What do I believe that most people don't?"
- Ship small, get real data
- Update beliefs based on results, not opinions

**Example:**
- Bad: "Best practice says we need 6 microservices"
- Good: "We shipped a monolith. It handles 10M users fine."

**When to use:** Making decisions, evaluating advice.

---

## Make it Easy to Take Risks

**What it is:** Keep costs low so you can bet big.

**How to use it:**
- Low fixed costs = high risk tolerance
- Save 6-12 months runway
- Take the scary opportunity

**Example:**
"Kept expenses at $3K/month so I could leave my job and build for a year with no revenue."

**When to use:** Structuring your life and business.

---

## Focus

**What it is:** Work on one thing that matters.

**How to use it:**
- Say no to everything except the top priority
- 80% of results come from 20% of work
- Kill the rest

**Example:**
- Bad: Working on 5 features at once
- Good: Shipped payments in 1 week. Everything else waits.

**When to use:** Every day, every week, every quarter.

---

## Work Hard

**What it is:** Outwork the competition early on.

**How to use it:**
- First 5 years: build momentum with intensity
- Later: work hard on right things, not all things
- Combine hard work + focus

**Example:**
"Shipped 3 features in 2 weeks by working nights. Built enough momentum to hire 2 engineers."

**When to use:** Building momentum, especially early in career or venture.

---

## Be Bold

**What it is:** Tackle ambitious problems others avoid.

**How to use it:**
- If it excites you and scares you, do it
- Ignore "that's impossible"
- Start before you're ready

**Example:**
- Bad: Build another to-do app
- Good: Build instant global money transfers for $0.01 per transaction

**When to use:** Choosing problems to solve.

---

## Be Willful

**What it is:** Make things happen through sheer determination.

**How to use it:**
- Ask for what you want
- Don't accept "no" as final
- Keep pushing until it works

**Example:**
"Messaged the CEO 5 times before he replied. Now he's our biggest customer."

**When to use:** Overcoming obstacles, closing deals, recruiting.

---

## Build Leverage

**What it is:** Do work that can't be replicated.

**How to use it:**
- Combine unique skills (e.g., engineering + design + sales)
- Build brand and relationships
- Own the customer relationship

**Example:**
"Only person who can code payments AND speak to banks AND sell to CFOs = hard to replace."

**When to use:** Career planning, skill development.

---

## Build a Network

**What it is:** Relationships are leverage.

**How to use it:**
- Help people generously with no expectation
- Stay in touch with talented people
- Your network becomes opportunities

**Example:**
"Helped Sarah debug her database for free in 2020. She introduced me to my co-founder in 2023."

**When to use:** Always. Make it a daily habit.

---

## Own Things

**What it is:** Wealth comes from equity, not salary.

**How to use it:**
- Take equity over cash when possible
- Build things that compound (products, businesses)
- Time-based income (salary) doesn't scale

**Example:**
- Bad: $200K salary for 10 years = $2M total
- Good: 1% equity in $200M company = $2M that compounds

**When to use:** Negotiating compensation, choosing opportunities.

---

## Be Internally Driven

**What it is:** Do what matters to you, not what impresses others.

**How to use it:**
- Ignore status games
- Work on problems you care about
- Internal motivation sustains you for decades

**Example:**
- Bad: Join prestigious company for the brand
- Good: Join unknown startup solving a problem you deeply care about

**When to use:** Making career and life decisions.
