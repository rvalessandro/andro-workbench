# Product Mental Models

How to build products customers love.

---

## TL;DR

- Jobs to be done - What progress do customers want?
- Working backwards - Start with press release
- Opportunity cost - Yes to X = No to Y
- MVP - Ship smallest valuable thing
- Reversible fast, irreversible slow
- Customer development - Talk to users constantly
- Kano model - Basic, Performance, Delighters
- First principles - Break down to fundamentals
- 80/20 rule - Focus on what matters

## Jobs to Be Done

**What it is:** People don't want products, they want progress.

**How to use it:**
1. What job is the customer trying to do?
2. What progress are they trying to make?
3. Build the solution that helps them make that progress

**Example:**
- Bad: "People want a faster drill"
- Good: "People want a hole in the wall. Ship pre-drilled shelves."

**When to use:** Understanding customer needs, designing features.

## Working Backwards

**What it is:** Start with the customer experience, work backwards to build it.

**How to use it:**
1. Write the press release for launch day
2. Write the FAQ customers will ask
3. Build the product that makes both true

**Example:**
Start with: "Today we launched instant transfers. Send money in 2 seconds, not 2 days."
Then build what makes that true.

**When to use:** Planning new products or features.

---

## Opportunity Cost

**What it is:** Saying yes to X means saying no to Y.

**How to use it:**
- For every "yes", ask: "What am I saying no to?"
- Make the tradeoff explicit
- Choose the bigger opportunity

**Example:**
"If we build feature A (2 months), we can't build feature B (2 months) until Q3. Which matters more?"

**When to use:** Prioritizing features or projects.

---

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**What it is:** Ship the smallest thing that creates value.

**How to use it:**
1. Identify core value proposition
2. Remove everything else
3. Ship and learn

**Example:**
- Bad: "Let's build 10 payment methods before launch"
- Good: "Ship with credit card only. Add more based on requests."

**When to use:** Launching new products or features.

---

## Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions

**What it is:** Type 1 (one-way door) vs Type 2 (two-way door) decisions.

**How to use it:**
- **Type 2 (reversible):** Decide in <1 hour, move fast
- **Type 1 (irreversible):** Take days/weeks, gather data

**Examples:**
- Type 2: Feature prioritization, UI changes, pricing experiments
- Type 1: Platform choice, database migration, brand repositioning

**When to use:** Every product decision.

---

## Customer Development

**What it is:** Talk to customers before, during, and after building.

**How to use it:**
1. Before: "What's the hardest part of X for you?"
2. During: "Does this solve your problem?"
3. After: "What would make this 10x better?"

**Example:**
- Bad: Build for 6 months, launch, hope customers love it
- Good: Talk to 10 customers, build MVP in 1 week, iterate based on feedback

**When to use:** Every stage of product development.

## Kano Model

**What it is:** Features fall into 3 categories: Basic, Performance, Delighters.

**How to use it:**
- **Basic:** Must-haves (login, payment). Customers expect them.
- **Performance:** More is better (speed, accuracy). Competitive advantage.
- **Delighters:** Unexpected wow moments. Differentiation.

**Example:**
- Basic: App loads
- Performance: App loads in <1 second
- Delighter: App predicts what you need before you ask

**When to use:** Prioritizing features, allocating resources.

---

## First Principles Thinking

**What it is:** Break problems down to fundamental truths.

**How to use it:**
1. Identify assumptions
2. Ask: "What must be true?"
3. Build solution from there

**Example:**
- Assumption: "Food delivery needs drivers"
- First principle: "People want food from restaurants at home"
- Solution: Partner with restaurants who have their own delivery

**When to use:** When conventional approaches aren't working.

---

## 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)

**What it is:** 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.

**How to use it:**
- Identify the 20% of features that deliver 80% of value
- Ship those first
- Kill or delay the rest

**Example:**
"90% of users only use 3 features: send, receive, check balance. Ship those. Hold the rest."

**When to use:** Feature prioritization, resource allocation.
