# Mental Models

Frameworks for thinking, not implementation details.

## What This Is About

This section is about **how to think** about problems, not how to solve them.

I don't claim these are the "right" ways to think. They're tools that have worked for me. Take what's useful, ignore the rest.

The goal: give you frameworks that help you make better decisions, approach problems differently, and see opportunities others miss.

## The Framework

### [How to be Successful](/mental-models/how-to-be-successful)

Three principles for building leverage, developing taste, and taking action.

**Key concepts:**
- Focus on leverage - Find the domino that knocks down the rest
- Develop taste - AI can execute, you need judgment
- Bias for action - Ship fast, but balance with leverage

**When to use:** Building products, scaling teams, making strategic decisions.

## Three Domains

### [General](/mental-models/general)

How to approach life and work.

**Key concepts:**
- Begin with the end in mind - Paint the picture before you build
- Compound yourself - Seek exponential growth
- Focus - One thing that matters
- Check your motives - Pure motives enable honest work

**When to use:** Daily decisions, career choices, life direction.

---

### [Product](/mental-models/product)

How to build products customers love.

**Key concepts:**
- Jobs to be done - What progress do customers want?
- Working backwards - Start with the press release
- MVP - Ship smallest valuable thing
- Customer development - Talk to users constantly

**When to use:** Product planning, feature prioritization, customer discovery.

---

### [Engineering](/mental-models/engineering)

How to think about building systems that scale.

**Key concepts:**
- Separate deploy from release - Ship code != change user experience
- Dual write migrations - Change systems without breaking them
- Make things reversible - Fast forward, instant rollback
- Optimize for iteration speed - Perfect later, working now

**When to use:** System design, architecture decisions, deployment planning.

---

## How to Use This

1. **Skim the TL;DR** at the top of each page
2. **Dive deep** on concepts that resonate
3. **Apply** to your current problem
4. **Update your thinking** based on results

These are thinking tools, not rules. Use them when they help. Ignore them when they don't.

Building on this over time.
