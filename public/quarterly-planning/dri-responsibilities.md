# DRI Responsibilities

Directly Responsible Individual - the one person responsible for delivery.

---

## TL;DR

- One person owns each initiative end-to-end
- Max 2 sprints per epic
- DRI coordinates, doesn't execute alone
- Weekly sync to track progress and unblock

---

## What DRIs Do

1. **Schedule meetings** - Own the communication cadence
2. **Break down epics** - Clear stories, test cases, acceptance criteria
3. **Maintain tracker** - Keep on track, escalate blockers early

---

## Tech DRIs

- May or may not code, but **not the sole executor**
- Can reallocate team members when needed
- Ask for help when off track
- Weekly meeting: share progress, blockers, learnings

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: DRI Does Everything**

DRI becomes bottleneck. Team disengaged.

**Fix:** DRI coordinates and delegates. Not the sole executor.

---

**Mistake 2: Multiple DRIs**

No one is actually responsible. Blame game starts.

**Fix:** One DRI per initiative. They can delegate, but ownership is clear.

---

**Mistake 3: DRI Without Authority**

Can't make decisions or reallocate resources. Blocked constantly.

**Fix:** Give DRI authority to make decisions and adjust team composition.

---

**Mistake 4: No Weekly Sync**

DRIs work in silos. Miss opportunities to help each other.

**Fix:** Weekly DRI sync. Share blockers, wins, insights.
