# Rock Sizing

How to prioritize and plan initiatives.

---

## TL;DR

- **Rocks** (>2 sprints): Strategic, long-term, maximize impact. Exec decides.
- **Pebbles** (6-20 days): Tactical, short-term, maximize ROI. PM decides.
- **Sand** (≤5 days): Immediate, maximize throughput. PM/Dev decides.

## Framework

|  | Rocks | Pebbles | Sand |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Effort** | > 2 Sprints | 6-20 days (up to 2 sprints) | ≤ 5 days |
| **Maximize** | Impact | ROI | Throughput |
| **Outlook** | Long-term: Winning over the next few years | Short-term: Winning over the next few months | Immediate: Short tasks that just need to be done |
| **Scope** | Strategic | Tactical | Any |
| **How Decide** | Deliberate | Analytical | Intuitive |
| **Role of Exec** | Decider | Observer | None |
| **Role of PM** | Driver | Decider | Decider (engage devs) |
| **Beware** | Insufficient impact | Over-estimating ROI | Over-thinking / over-planning |

## How to Prioritize

1. **Start with Rocks:** What are the 1-3 strategic bets for the quarter?
2. **Fill with Pebbles:** What tactical wins support the rocks?
3. **Leave room for Sand:** Reserve 20-30% capacity for quick wins and urgent fixes.

**Example Quarter:**
- Rock: Launch payments in 3 new countries (12 weeks)
- Pebbles: Add Apple Pay, optimize checkout flow, integrate fraud detection
- Sand: Fix bugs, update copy, improve error messages

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: All Rocks, No Pebbles**

Team burns out. No quick wins to show progress.

**Fix:** Balance rocks with pebbles. Ship something every 2 weeks.

---

**Mistake 2: All Sand, No Rocks**

Busy but not moving forward strategically.

**Fix:** Dedicate 50%+ capacity to rocks and pebbles.

---

**Mistake 3: Rocks Without Milestones**

Can't measure progress. Team loses motivation.

**Fix:** Break rocks into 2-sprint epics with clear deliverables.
