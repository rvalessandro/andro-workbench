## How They Work Together

These two frameworks complement each other:

**Written Communication** focuses on clarity and structure. Use it to:
- Write status updates, proposals, and emails
- Structure your thinking before you communicate
- Get to the point quickly
- Make your ask clear

**Feedback & Difficult Conversations** focuses on empathy and directness. Use it to:
- Give feedback on behavior
- Resolve conflicts
- Express needs without blame
- Navigate conversations where emotions are high
- Stay in Radical Candor (care personally + challenge directly)

**Example - Giving feedback on late PRs:**

**Written Communication approach:**
```
PRs are taking 4 days to review (target: 24 hours).
This blocks 3 features from shipping on time.

Recommendation: Add PR review to daily standup checklist.

Approve by Friday so we can start Monday.
```

**Radical Candor + NVC approach:**
```
When PRs sit for 4 days without review (happened on last 3 PRs),
I feel worried because I value shipping on time for our users.
I know you're juggling multiple priorities—I've seen your great work balancing them.
Would you be willing to review PRs within 24 hours
or let me know if you need me to find another reviewer?
```

**When to use which:**
- **Written Communication**: Status updates, proposals, announcements, documentation
- **Feedback & Difficult Conversations**: 1:1 feedback, performance reviews, conflict resolution, building trust

Both share core principles:
- Be specific (no weasel words)
- Be clear (no vague requests)
- Respect the reader's time
- Make it actionable
- Check your motives first
