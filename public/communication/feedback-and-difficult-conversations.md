# Feedback & Difficult Conversations

How to care personally and challenge directly.

---

## TL;DR

**Radical Candor = Care Personally + Challenge Directly**

**Non-Violent Communication (NVC) = The framework to achieve Radical Candor**

When giving feedback, use this structure:
1. **Observe** - State facts, not judgments ("You interrupted Sarah 3 times" not "You're rude")
2. **Feel** - Own your emotion ("I feel concerned" not "You made me angry")
3. **Need** - Name what you value ("I value everyone being heard")
4. **Request** - Ask for specific action ("Would you be willing to let people finish?")
5. **Care** - Show you care ("I know you're excited about the project")

**Check your motives first** - Without pure motives, these become manipulation.

---

## Why This Matters

Most feedback fails because we either:
- **Care but don't challenge** - Avoid hard truths to keep the peace (Ruinous Empathy)
- **Challenge but don't care** - Give harsh feedback without empathy (Obnoxious Aggression)
- **Neither** - Give vague, political feedback (Manipulative Insincerity)

**Radical Candor** combines caring personally with challenging directly. **Non-Violent Communication** gives you the framework to do both.

**The connection to motives:** This only works with pure motives. If you're trying to prove you're right, make someone feel bad, or protect your ego, the frameworks become manipulation. [Check your motives first](/mental-models/general#check-your-motives).

## The Radical Candor Matrix

```
                    Challenge Directly
                            ↑
                            |
    Obnoxious        |      Radical
    Aggression       |      Candor
                     |
────────────────────┼────────────────────→ Care Personally
                     |
    Manipulative     |      Ruinous
    Insincerity      |      Empathy
                     |
```

**The quadrants:**

| **Quadrant** | **What It Is** | **Example** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Radical Candor** | Care + Challenge | "When you interrupted Sarah 3 times in the meeting, I felt concerned because I value everyone being heard. Your input is important, and so is hers. Would you be willing to let people finish before responding?" |
| **Ruinous Empathy** | Care but no challenge | "You're doing great!" (when they're not) |
| **Obnoxious Aggression** | Challenge but no care | "Stop interrupting people." |
| **Manipulative Insincerity** | Neither | "Some people feel you could improve meeting dynamics." |

**The goal:** Stay in Radical Candor. Use Non-Violent Communication to get there.

## The Framework: Non-Violent Communication

NVC gives you the structure to care personally and challenge directly at the same time.

**Structure:**
1. **Observe** - State facts (what would a camera record?)
2. **Feel** - Own your emotion (not "you made me feel")
3. **Need** - Identify what you value (the underlying need)
4. **Request** - Ask for specific action (concrete, doable)
5. **Care** - Acknowledge their strengths or context

**Template:**
```
When [observation],
I feel [feeling] because I value [need].
[Show care: acknowledge capability/context]
Would you be willing to [request]?
```

---

## Step 1: Observe (Not Judge)

**The insight:** Facts can't be argued with. Judgments create defensiveness.

**How to do it:**
- What would a camera record?
- No "always", "never", "should"
- No mind-reading ("you don't care")

**Examples:**

| **Judgment** | **Observation** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "You're unprofessional" | "You interrupted me 3 times in the client meeting" |
| "You don't care about quality" | "The last 2 PRs had failing tests" |
| "You're lazy" | "You shipped 2 features this month vs goal of 5" |

---

## Step 2: Feel (Not Think)

**The insight:** "I feel that you're wrong" is not a feeling. Own your emotion without blame.

**How to do it:**
- Use feeling words: frustrated, worried, disappointed, confused
- Not "I feel that..." or "I feel like..." (these are thoughts)
- Own it: "I feel" not "You made me feel"

**Examples:**

| **Fake Feeling (Thought)** | **Real Feeling** |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| "I feel like you don't care" | "I feel disappointed" |
| "I feel that you're wrong" | "I feel confused" |
| "I feel like this won't work" | "I feel worried" |

---

## Step 3: Need (What You Value)

**The insight:** Feelings come from unmet needs. Name the need to shift from blame to understanding.

**Common needs:**
- Autonomy, Competence, Connection, Meaning, Safety, Respect

**How to do it:**
- Ask: "What do I care about here?"
- Universal needs (respect), not person-specific ("I need you to...")
- Connect: "I feel [feeling] because I value [need]"

**Examples:**

| **Without Need** | **With Need** |
|------------------|---------------|
| "I'm frustrated you didn't update me" | "I'm frustrated because I value transparency when deadlines change" |
| "I'm disappointed in this work" | "I'm disappointed because I value high quality work that serves users" |

---

## Step 4: Request (Be Specific)

**The insight:** A complaint without a request is venting. Make it actionable.

**How to do it:**
- Ask for specific behavior (not attitude)
- Make it doable
- "Would you be willing to..." (not "You need to...")

**Examples:**

| **Vague** | **Specific** |
|-----------|--------------|
| "Be more responsive" | "Reply to Slack within 4 hours during work hours?" |
| "Test your code better" | "Run full test suite before submitting PRs?" |
| "Communicate better" | "Send 2-line update every Friday with blockers?" |

---

## Step 5: Care (Show It)

**The insight:** People hear hard truths when they know you care.

**How to do it:**
- Acknowledge capability: "I've seen your great work on..."
- Understand context: "I know you're dealing with a lot..."
- Assume good intent: "I know you care about quality..."

**Example:**
> "Last 2 PRs had failing tests. I value shipping reliable code. I've seen your great work on payments. Would you run the full test suite before submitting PRs?"

---

## Examples: All Quadrants

### Code Quality

**Ruinous Empathy:** "Good work!" (tests are failing)

**Manipulative Insincerity:** "Perhaps we could improve testing practices."

**Obnoxious Aggression:** "Your code has failing tests. Did you even run them?"

**Radical Candor:**
> "Last 2 PRs had failing tests. I value shipping reliable code. I've seen your great payment system work. Would you run the full test suite before submitting PRs?"

---

### Meeting Behavior

**Ruinous Empathy:** "Great energy!" (they interrupted everyone)

**Manipulative Insincerity:** "Some people feel meeting dynamics could improve."

**Obnoxious Aggression:** "Stop interrupting people. It's rude."

**Radical Candor:**
> "You interrupted Sarah 3 times today. I value everyone being heard. I know you're excited about the project. Would you let people finish before responding?"

---

### Missed Deadline

**Ruinous Empathy:** "No worries! We can push it." (impacts revenue)

**Manipulative Insincerity:** "We should discuss timeline management."

**Obnoxious Aggression:** "You missed the deadline. Third time. Get it together."

**Radical Candor:**
> "API was due Friday, shipped Monday (3 days late). This impacts Q4 revenue by $50K. I know you're juggling multiple projects. Would you flag blockers 2 days before deadlines so we can help or adjust?"

---

## The Connection to Motives

Radical Candor and NVC only work with pure motives.

**Impure motives corrupt the frameworks:**

| **Impure Motive** | **What It Looks Like** |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Need to be right | Build a case: "I've documented every time you were wrong..." |
| Seek recognition | Give feedback publicly to look good |
| Prove something | Use feelings to guilt: "I feel disappointed because I expected better" |
| Protect ego | Get defensive when they give you feedback |

**Pure motives enable honest feedback:**

| **Pure Motive** | **What It Enables** |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Serve others | Give feedback to help them grow, not prove you're right |
| Can celebrate their success | Want them to succeed, even if they do it differently |
| Not defensive | Can hear their feedback without protecting ego |
| Would do anonymously | Give feedback even if no one knows it's from you |

**Before giving feedback, ask:**
- Am I trying to help them grow or prove I'm right?
- Would I give this feedback if no one knew it came from me?
- Can I celebrate if they succeed with a different approach?

See [Check Your Motives](/mental-models/general#check-your-motives) for the full framework.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Judgments instead of observations**
- Bad: "You're lazy"
- Good: "You shipped 2 features this month vs goal of 5"

**Mistake 2: Blame disguised as feeling**
- Bad: "I feel like you're being unfair"
- Good: "I feel frustrated because I value fairness"

**Mistake 3: Vague requests**
- Bad: "Be better at communication"
- Good: "Send a 2-line update every Friday with blockers?"

**Mistake 4: Challenge without care**
- Bad: "You missed the deadline. Don't let it happen again."
- Good: Add care: "I know you're juggling a lot. Would you be willing to flag blockers 2 days early so we can help?"

**Mistake 5: Care without challenge**
- Bad: "You're working hard!" (they're not hitting goals)
- Good: Add challenge: "I see you're putting in hours. When I look at velocity (2 vs 5 features/month), I feel concerned. Let's talk about what's blocking you."
