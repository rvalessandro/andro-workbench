## Understanding Level Equivalencies

**IC levels map roughly to manager levels:**

| IC Level | Manager Level | Seniority |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| IC2 | ~ Entry | Mid-level contributor |
| IC3 | ~ M1 | Senior contributor / New manager |
| IC4 | ~ M2 | Lead / Senior manager |
| Staff/Principal | ~ M3 | Strategic leadership |

**Key insight:** IC4 Engineer and M2 Manager are roughly equivalent in seniority. Management is a role change, not a promotion.

**You can switch:**
- IC3 → M1 (common)
- M1 → IC3 (less common but valid)
- IC4 → M2 (if you want to scale people management)

## Core Dimensions: How We Evaluate at Each Level

### 1. Problem Scope

| IC3 | Given goals ("Move this metric") |
| IC4 | Given domains ("Own this area") |
| M1-M3 | Deliver outcomes through people |

## How to Use This for Career Growth

**Step 1: Identify your current level**
- Read the level descriptions above
- Be honest about where you consistently operate (not your best day)
- If you're between levels, pick the lower one

**Step 2: Understand the next level**
- Read the expectations for the next level
- Identify the 2-3 biggest gaps between where you are and where you want to be
- See role-specific "Path to Next Level" in detailed docs

**Step 3: Set quarterly goals**
- Use quarterly 1:1 template to set goals that bridge the gap
- Focus on 2-3 next-level behaviors
- Track progress in biweekly check-ins

**Step 4: Operate at next level for 2-3 quarters**
- Consistently demonstrate next-level impact
- Get feedback from manager/peers
- Promotion happens when you've proven sustained performance

---

## Common Patterns

**From IC1 → IC2:**
- Shift from "ship this feature" to "own this problem"
- Start designing solutions instead of following instructions
- Begin thinking in quarters, not weeks

**From IC2 → IC3:**
- Shift from "own features" to "drive outcomes"
- Lead cross-functional work, not just execute it
- Focus on business impact, not just technical quality

**From IC3 → IC4:**
- Shift from "lead projects" to "set strategy"
- Influence org-wide, not just your team
- Multiply through others, not just personal output

**From IC → Manager:**
- Shift from "doing" to "enabling"
- Success measured by team output, not personal output
- Spend time on 1:1s, hiring, coaching instead of hands-on work

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

**❌ "I've been here 2 years, I deserve a promotion"**
- Time doesn't earn promotions. Impact does.

**❌ "I do senior work sometimes, so I'm a senior"**
- You need to operate consistently at the next level for 2-3 quarters.

**❌ "I want to be promoted before I do next-level work"**
- Promotions recognize sustained performance, not potential.

**❌ "Management is the only way up"**
- IC track goes just as high (IC4 = M2 in seniority).

**❌ "I'll get promoted by being good at my current level"**
- You get promoted by demonstrating next-level impact.

## Role-Specific Details

This doc gives you the framework. For specific expectations and examples:

- **Engineers:** See [Software Engineer Levels](software-engineer-levels.md)
- **PMs:** See [Product Manager Levels](product-manager-levels.md)

Each role-specific doc includes:
- Detailed "What you do" at each level
- Specific success criteria
- "Path to Next Level" focus areas
- Example quarterly goals

---

## TL;DR

**Levels are about impact, not time:**
- IC0-IC1: Learn and execute
- IC2: Own problems
- IC3: Drive outcomes
- IC4: Set strategy
- M1-M3: Multiply through people

**To level up:**
1. Identify current level
2. Focus on 2-3 gaps to next level
3. Set quarterly goals that bridge the gap
4. Operate at next level for 2-3 quarters
5. Get promoted when you've proven sustained impact

**Key principle:** Promotions recognize sustained performance at the next level, not reward for current-level excellence.

Use this overview to understand the framework, then dive into role-specific docs for details.
